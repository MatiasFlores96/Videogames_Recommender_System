# Hybrid Videogame Recommender System

This repository contains the source code for the Master's thesis **"Hybrid Videogame Recommender System Integrating User Behavior, Game Attributes, and Community Ratings"** by Mat√≠as Flores (ITBA).

The main goal is to develop and compare videogame recommender systems for the Steam platform, evaluating a traditional **collaborative filtering** model against a **hybrid** model that integrates collaborative filtering, content-based, and sentiment analysis approaches, all implemented with KerasRS.

## üöÄ Project Goals

## üéØ Thesis Objectives

- Implement a **collaborative filtering** system based on historical user-game interaction patterns.
- Develop a **content-based** system that recommends games according to their attributes (genre, developer, tags, etc.).
- Incorporate a **sentiment analysis** module on user reviews using NLP.
- Build a **hybrid model** that combines the three previous approaches.
- Compare the performance of the hybrid model against the pure collaborative filtering model, using metrics such as recall@k and ndcg@k.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

   # or

1.  **Data Preparation**:
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    python Code/01_generacion_dataset.py
    ```

2.  **Analysis and Modeling**:
    Once the processed dataset exists, you can run the analysis or modeling scripts. These scripts load the `.parquet` file directly, making them fast and efficient.
